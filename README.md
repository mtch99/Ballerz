[ ] Init Feed Page
    - [ ] Feed Model, used for data transfer betweeen controller and view
    - [ ] Feed Controller, only calls the use case to execute requests for view data. View data is a state managed by the store, which listen to the use case for updates. Controller renders the view
    - [ ] Feed View

    - [ ] Feed Screen, contains the controller(s)
