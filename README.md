# Ballerz
The app for finding basketball pickup games


## Branch Purpose
    I want to create a game
## Next 
Test these scenarios:
    `TODO: define next scenarios` 
    - Places and users search
    - I want to add my favorite playground
        
There must be three different games on three different courts, two at the moment, and one other on saturday


## How? (technical)

- [x] FeedUseCase
- [x] CreateGameStack

* [ ] Refactor Searchcreen using react native tab view


TODO: scenario10
- [ ] UserProfileScreen
            - [ ] add stats
* [ ] inject profilepic uri
* [ ] Fix userProfileScreen virtualized list in scrollView Error





## Post-Testing Adjustments
TODO: Test that comment icon is explicit, now that there is a feed item with a comments section
