# Ballerz
The app for finding basketball pickup games


## Branch Purpose
    I want to create a game
## Next 
Test these scenarios:
    `TODO: define next scenarios` 
    - Places and users search
    - I want to add my favorite playground
        
There must be three different games on three different courts, two at the moment, and one other on saturday


## How? (technical)

- [ ] FeedUseCase
    - [x] createGame method on usecase and controller
    - [x] newGameEventAction on Feed slice
    - [ ] Test
        - [ ] Left Header button in feedScreen
            - [ ] The createGameMethod is imported from the feed controller of the app context
            - [ ] SetDate to now by default
            - [ ] Validate feature by viewing the feed update with a new element
            - [ ] The new element must come on top of the list



- [ ] CreateGameStack
    - [ ] CreateGameScreen
    - [ ] CreateGameView





TODO: Unfinished work on scenario10
- [ ] UserProfileScreen
            - [ ] add stats
* [ ] inject profilepic uri
* [ ] Fix userProfileScreen virtualized list in scrollView Error
    * [ ] Refactor Searchcreen using react native tab view





## Post-Testing Adjustments
TODO: Test that comment icon is explicit, now that there is a feed item with a comments section
