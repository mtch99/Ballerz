# Ballerz
The app for finding basketball pickup games


## Branch Purpose
    I want to look at a group chat conversation and see an invite

## Next 
Test these scenarios:
    `TODO: define next scenarios` 
    - I want to see a place profile
        
There must be three different games on three different courts, two at the moment, and one other on saturday


## How? (technical)
- [ ] GroupChatGameInvitation component
    - [ ] Define the props
    - [ ] Implement view


## Post-Testing Adjustments
TODO: Test that comment icon is explicit, now that there is a feed item with a comments section
