# Ballerz
The app for finding basketball pickup games


## Branch Purpose
    I want to invite friends to the app by text messages, messenger and other medias
## Next 
Test these scenarios:
    `TODO: define next scenarios` 
    - I want to see a place profile
        
There must be three different games on three different courts, two at the moment, and one other on saturday


## How? (technical)
- [ ] UserProfileList Screen
    - [ ] UserProfile Item
    - [ ] Search Icon as right header
- [x] Share action on invitation link press


## Post-Testing Adjustments
TODO: Test that comment icon is explicit, now that there is a feed item with a comments section
